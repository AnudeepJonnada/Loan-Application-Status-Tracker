## 🔁 Reflections

Agile helped break the project into small tasks, which I tracked using Azure DevOps. This made the app easy to manage and test feature-by-feature, especially across Power Apps, SharePoint, and Power Automate.

This Agile documentation demonstrates real-world development methodology and aligns with best practices expected at enterprise-level internship roles.
